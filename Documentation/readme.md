# Design Patterns
__In Object Oriented Programming__

This project is for educational purpusses, I am learning more about object oriented design patterns and decided to
create a repository that explain several commonly used patterns while I'm learning about them. I think the best way
to learn about stuff is to write tutorials or examples for other people, this is because it forces you to really
think about what you learn and validate your own knowledge. This means that I am also currently learning and that I
could be misunderstanding the concepts, so I often rewrite the articles while I learned something new and you are
are free to correct me. This also means that you shouldn't use this as an absolute truth for an test or something use
some good books instead like: [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007124?tag=chrokh01-20)
or [Design Patterns: elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-dp-0201633612/dp/0201633612/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=).
